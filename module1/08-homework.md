## `vector` - template class

Implement your own `vector<T>` class. It should have the same behaviour as `std::vector<T>`

Remember about internal member types.

Remember about `bool` specialization.

You don't need to remember about all constructors.

More advanced version can also have a template parameter `Allocator`.

You don't need to implement everything. Just start and try as much as you can.

___

## `remove` - template function

Implement your own `remove()` function. It should mimic the behaviour of `std::remove()` algorithm.

___

### Code Review

Send me a link to the repository with your implementation for my code review.
