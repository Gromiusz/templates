# Templates

___

## Rationale

**Templates are used to avoid code duplication.**
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Later it was discovered that C++ templates are a Turing-complete language. It means that the templates itself are a programming language. It is often called **C++ template meta-programming**.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

All templates are evaluated during the compilation phase.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

## Template types

In C++03 we have had

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> template functions
* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> template classes

From C++11 we can also have
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> template variables

And from C++20 we can have
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" --> template lambdas
